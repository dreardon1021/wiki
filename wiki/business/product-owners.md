title: Product Owners

Product Owners can be intimidating. Their love and passion for their product shines as bright as the North Star in the night sky. While they may put on a strong face of knowing everything about their product, some may not know a lot about the codebase or how it operates. Some know what they want to do, but not how to execute it.

Having a business sense as a software engineer can help you work with a product owner. It is important to recognize when you are needed to take the lead. The product owner might be looking to you directly for solutions and the best course of action. Don't forget the owner is also looking for the most cost efficient way to accomplish the task at hand.

Providing estimates on how long a feature will take and what should be prioritized, is something that a developer should focus on. When doing this it might be best to not use too many over complicated technical terms as the owner might not understand them. I know it is hard to explain technical things to someone without using technical terms, but it is certainly a great skill to have. While this is something I myself am trying to get better at, I know a few people who can do this very well. They can think of great analogies that make sense to everyone.

Also while providing estimates and solutions, stay positive! Try not to scare the product owner. They want the product to succeed and any thought of it possibly failing could possibly upset them. So remember, be personable, use your communication and people skills, and be positive!
